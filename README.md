# Task Manager Tool
## Features
- Add tasks
- Delete tasks

## Resolving the merge conflict
First of all, the merge conflict in README.md is caused by simultaneous edits of the file in both branches, that is feature/add-tasks and feature/delete-tasks
This is resolved by manually editing both features in the file
